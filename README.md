## ‚ú® Optimization & Accessibility
- **Fluid Layouts**: All grids and flex layouts use `min-w-0`, responsive breakpoints, and spacing utilities.
- **Image Optimization**: All images use `loading="lazy"` and fixed aspect ratios.
- **Accessibility**: Semantic tags (`<section>`, `<article>`), ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation on all cards and buttons.
- **Performance**: Pure presentational components use `React.memo` to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- **Consistent UI**: Tailwind CSS for spacing, color, and typography.
